AUTHOR:     Jeferson Morales Mariciano
PROBLEM:    Verify validity of a set of courses.
INPUT:
    List of courses, each with its prerequisites.
    Each course is listed on a line of input with the following format: COURSE_NAME:{COURSE_NAME, ...}
    The list of prerequisites may be empty.
    The prerequisites for a course C are courses that must be passed before course C can be taken.

VALID:
    It must be possible to take the course and its prerequisites within 5 years, 10 semester program.
INVALID:
    - There can't be a chain of > 10 consecutive prerequisites.
    - Can't take > 60 courses in total, each course can't have > 59 direct or indirect prerequisites.
    - Course with circular chain of prerequisites
    - Course with even a single invalid prerequisite (direct or indirect).

ASSUMPTIONS:
    A course can't be repeated as main course in more than 1 line.
    A course present in a dependency and never more, is considered non-existing and make its dependent courses invalid.
    There can be multiple unconnected graphs within the structure.

STRATEGY:
    - All collections used could be done with plain arrays and integer indexes, such approach has not been used
        in order to show familiarity with data structures (hashset: set(), hashmap: dict)
    - An approach would be DFS, exploring the graph and keeping track foreach node the depth, [un]directed connections,
        and mark properly if a cycle is present. I choose if a cycle is present, not only to include such course in an
        invalid list of courses, but also to mark its connections and depth to MAX_VALUES defined below in order to
        increase security.
    - Since we don't explore again nodes already visited, but in order to know the [un]directed connected nodes, we need
        to store such number foreach node in a collection so when we reach an already visited node, we don't visit again
        that path but look for its values to increase the current parent node ones.
