# university-notes
A repository hosting the educational material used and created during my university bachelor's in Informatics at USI.

aterlier/cv/ is in .gitignore because I switched my cv from the EU standard format (Europass) to my own
Latex format due to a 1st semester assignment of Sofware Atelier 1.
Now, cv has it's own repository.

pf/pacman-racket/ is in .gitignore because the pacman game project developed in Racket for
Programming Fundamentals 1 has now it's own repository.
