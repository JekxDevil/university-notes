            <p>
                Our strict privacy police enable us to state that pranks must be and remain in the funny side.<br>
                If anything related to bullying is happening, the prank can be shut down by whoever wants it in any time.<br>
                <em>The Prank Bang Company</em> does not has any part in any legal battle the prank could lead.

                ACT no. 675 of 31.12.1996. As amended by Legislative Decree no. 123 of 09.05.1997, no. 255 of 28.07.1997, no. 135 of 08.05.1998, no. 171 of 13.05.1998, no. 389 of 6.11.1998, no. 51 of 26.02.1999, no. 135 of 11.05.1999, no. 281 of 30.07.1999, no. 282 of 30.07.1999 and no. 467 of 28.12.2001.<br>
                Amendments are shown in italian. Personal data laws are becoming increasingly a tool for the overall protection of fundamental human rights, thereby adding significantly to the conventional privacy framework.<br>
                The recent Italian Data Protection Act (no. 675 of 31.12.1996) regards privacy protection as a part of a larger whole-taking also account of guidelines already included in the European Directive of 1995:
                indeed, personal data are to be processed "by respecting the rights, fundamental freedoms and dignity of natural persons, in particular with regard to privacy and personal identity".<br>
                Thus, privacy becomes a fundamental component of the "electronic citizenship" which will be a basic features of the next millennium.

            <h3>Trolling</h3>
            <p>Pranks are being stored as logs for legal purposes.<br>
            Anonymity is not allowed but the data is stored for a couple of months and then deleted.<br>
            In case of frequent pranks to defame a person, <em>The Company</em> reserves the right to shut down the prank in any of its forms.</p>

                If someone is cyberbullied because of race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, disability or religion, it may overlap with discriminatory harassment and federal civil rights laws.<br>
                In fact, many cyberbullying cases wind up getting prosecuted as harassment. Consequently, some of the cases will end up in civil court while others might warrant criminal charges and prosecution for hate crimes, impersonation, harassment and violations under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).<br>
                In addition to these larger laws, individual states have their own laws and regulations regarding cyberbullying that vary state by state. 
                The government website, <a href="https://www.StopBullying.gov">StopBullying.gov</a>, provides a state-by-state map that highlights the specific policies.<br>
