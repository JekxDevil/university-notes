                At PrankBang headquarters we invented a unit of measure for fun.<br>
                It's solely based on the weird humor the fundator <em>James J. Jameson</em> has.<br>
                The Prank Bang ratio was born due to a prank the fundator did a couple of days before the company fundation.<br>
                James was hanging out with friends and pretended that he was depressed and nearly to kill himself.<br>
                Then, he took out a gun and pretended he wanted to kill everybody happier than him and then commit suicide.<br>
                He was dead serious during his speech and with a friend, Flavio, who was aware of all, the prank started.<br>
                He shoot Flavio with blanks, Flavio had a tomato sauce plastic bag between his clothes and pretended to bleed to death.<br>
                The others started to cry and called police but James placed a jammer to interrupt phone signal and finally shoot himself in the head.<br>
                From the gun appeared a stick with a paper attached which stated <strong><q>You have been QUACKED!</q></strong>.<br>
                All of it was recorded and people were crying.<br>
                James stated that the prank and the <i>bang</i> of the gun were correlated in an astral unit of measure of hilarity.<br>
                The prank he did had an 100% <abbr>PG</abbr> ratio.
