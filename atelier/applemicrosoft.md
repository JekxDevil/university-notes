## The calm before the storm

Both found in the late 1970s. 

Firstly Microsoft was interested in developing software while Apple was focused in hardware and desktop computer designing. Microsoft programs were meant to support  Apple PCs.

A sappy relationship were Bill once in a while checked how Steve was doing in Cupertino and vice versa.

One day Jobs went to meet Gates with the idea of Microsoft collaborating to implement software in the new Apple GUI. Jobs attitude was Steve Jobs sales mode, which is "I don't need you but I would let you be involved". Bill wasn't impressed.

## Rivalry

Then both startups observed overlapping of business interests and the fierce business rivalry began during most of 1980s and 1990s.

Mac people vs PC people. Advertising fight. Court fight:

Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation was a copyright infringement suit issued by Apple in 1988 where Apple said Microsoft had used elementws of the Mac GUI in its Windows operating system that were beyond the parts licensed by Microsoft from Apple during the Windows 1.0 in 1985. Microsoft won.

In the TV documentary '**Triumph of the nerds**' (1996), Jobs said Microsoft had "absolutely no taste", that made "third rate products", that "lacked insight and creativity". 

**Steve Jobs**: “The only  problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste, they have **absolutely  no taste**, and what that means is – I don’t mean that in a small way I  mean that in a big way. In the sense that they don’t think of original  ideas and they don’t bring much culture into their product ehm and you  say why is that important – well you know proportionally spaced fonts  come from type setting and beautiful books, that’s where one gets the  idea – if it weren’t for the Mac they would never have that in their  products and ehm so I guess I am saddened, not by Microsoft’s success – I have no problem with their success, they’ve earned their success for  the most part. I have a problem with the fact that they just make really **third rate products**.”

Then Jobs called Bill to apologize and telling him that he believed each word he said but he shouldn't have said it in public.

## Microsoft saves Apple

In August 1997, Apple's stock price descended to 88 cent. Jobs became CEO and cancelled Newton, Cyberdog and other product lines developed during his exile from the company. Bill saved Apple from bankruptcy by pumping 150 million in Apple stock. Maybe to elude governement anti-trust and DOJ sue? The cash fusion worked and Apple price peaked back in 1999. The deal was announced at Macworld Boston 1997. The Time journal showed in the cover Jobs thanking Bill for saving Apple. Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer were available for Macintosh. Then the iMac arrived, and the iPod, iPhone, iPad and Apple became the most valuable brand in the world. The stake Microsft had, now will be valued over 52 billion.

## A never ending war

In recent years, the rivalry between the two big companies have continued the fight. Microsoft introduced a new Surface branded lineup aimed to target Apple customer who desired an high-end laptop by including a touch screen and a stylus pen. Apple replied with new macbook featuring the touch bar.

During 2010s, Microsoft wanted to offer a valid alternative to Apple's iOS and Google's Android 96.8% market share, in the mobile selling business. Microsoft bought Nokia but failed miserably with Lumia mobile phones.

## Jobs and Gates

At D5 conference interview in 2007, Steve and Gates were recognized as two absolute innovator of the newborn technology sector. They were business rivals who occasionally appeared together to talk about past times. Then Bill Gates stepped down as CEO of Microsoft in 200 and in 2006 from the company to become a philanthropist. Job resigned as CEO in August 2011, dying a couple of months after. Bill said that there was no peace to make because they were not at war, they were just making great products in a positively competitive field.
